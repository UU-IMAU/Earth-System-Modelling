# IMAU workgroup on Earth System Modelling

The stated aims of this group are:
* to bring together different groups within IMAU working with ESMs; 
* to keep everyone informed about ongoing modelling research at IMAU;
* to facilitate the exchange of simulation data and data analysis scripts;
* to coordinate new simulations: ideally with synergy for multiple groups. 

The kick-off ESM meeting will be fully virtual and take place on 22 October, from 11:00 to 12:30 on [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NmQ2NDU5NGEtNGU4OC00Y2YxLWJlNmUtZmM4MWQ2MDJhNjhk%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22747a2490-0010-44ed-bacb-b7fa2b333df5%22%7d). The kick-off meeting will be dedicated to settling practical issues and getting an overview on current and upcoming modelling projects.
