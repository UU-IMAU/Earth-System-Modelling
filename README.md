# Earth System Modelling workgroup

The aims of this group are:
* to bring together different groups within IMAU working with ESMs;
* to provide practical information, for example on simulations existing at IMAU, login in on the supercomputer, etc... 
* to facilitate the exchange of simulation data and data analysis scripts;
* to exchange tips during ESM-for-Lunch meetings. 

The wiki of this repository serves as entry point: It gives an overview on which information is available where, and provides links. 
In general, contributors can choose between uploading their controbutions in this repository, or providing a links to, for example, their own repositories.
